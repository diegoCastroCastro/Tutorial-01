						<h1>Reviews</h1>>
						<blockquote>
								<p>The culinari art of the food trunk vendor has been steadily
								improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from
								Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai.
								Sajja Adulet ir to be congratulated ofr offering delicious
								and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think
								Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off
								the streets of Charlotte.</p>

						<blockquote>
								<p>Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare
								and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the
								convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you
								don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a
								master chef at serveral fine establishment on the East Coast,
								Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dinning to thw
								Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.</p>
